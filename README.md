# Note
This Login/Auth Scratch is mostly built based on the tutorial/blog by [Build a Login/Auth App with the MERN Stack Series 1/2/3](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-login-auth-app-with-mern-stack-part-1-c405048e3669).

# HOW TO RUN THIS APP
Simply copy the url and pull the repo locally. You can run <code>$ npm run dev</code> after you enter the mern_kidcare_app directory. Pay attention that you need to config your own environment variables, like setting up Mongo account, app Port selection etc.
